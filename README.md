## MLflow Applications

This repository contains two machine learning projects that demonstrate the use of **MLflow** for experiment tracking, model evaluation, and deployment:

### ðŸ“Œ Project 1: House Price Prediction (California)

This project applies **MLflow experiment tracking** to train and evaluate a Random Forest model for predicting house prices in California.

- Performs hyperparameter tuning using grid search  
- Logs model parameters, metrics, and artifacts to MLflow  
- Compares model performance to identify the best configuration

### ðŸ“Œ Project 2: Diabetes Prediction and Deployment

This project leverages MLflow to train and optimize a model for diabetes prediction using neural networks.

- Uses MLflow sweeps for automated hyperparameter optimization  
- Deploys the best model via a REST API using MLflowâ€™s serving tools
